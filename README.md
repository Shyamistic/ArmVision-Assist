## 🚀 The Problem
Visually impaired users rely on cloud-based vision tools that are:
1.  **Slow:** Latency kills the experience.
2.  **Privacy-Invasive:** Sending camera feeds to the cloud is risky.
3.  **Passive:** They just "read" text; they don't help you *act* on it.

## 💡 The Solution: ArmVision Assist
ArmVision Assist is an **offline AI Agent** optimized for ARM processors. It doesn't just read; it understands.
* **0% Latency:** Runs entirely on-device using ML Kit.
* **Context Aware:** Instantly distinguishes a **Menu** from a **Warning Sign**.
* **Action Engine:** Automatically converts static text into **Clickable Actions** (Call, Email, Open Link).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (ARM Optimized)
* **Language:** Kotlin (Native Android)
* **Vision Pipeline:** CameraX + Google ML Kit (Quantized on-device models)
* **Intelligence:** Custom Regex Context Engine
* **Haptics:** Sensory feedback loop for non-visual confirmation.

## 🌟 Key Features
1.  **Smart HUD:** Corner-bracket tracking with real-time "inference speed" display.
2.  **Safety Guard:** Detects words like "DANGER" or "WARNING" and triggers a priority haptic alert.
3.  **Action Chips:** Scanned a phone number? A "Call" button appears instantly.
4.  **Low-Light Boost:** Auto-detects darkness and engages the flash.
